=====================================

Explanation:

The name field specifies the name of the workflow.
The on field specifies that the workflow is triggered manually via the GitHub Actions page on the repo.
The jobs field specifies the jobs that should be run in this workflow.
The loadtest job is configured to run on two different runners, one Ubuntu and one MacOS, using the runs-on field and the matrix strategy.
The steps field specifies the steps to be executed in this job.
The first step checks out the repository using the actions/checkout action.
The second step installs sysbench on the runner.
The final step runs a sysbench CPU test with two threads for 60 seconds using the sysbench cpu command.
