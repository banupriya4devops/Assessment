====================

In this workflow, I am doing below.

Defining the name of the workflow as "Build Webserver Container"
Setting the workflow to trigger on push actions to the main branch
Defining a single job named "build" that will run on an Ubuntu virtual environment
Checking out the repository using the actions/checkout action
Building a Docker container named "my-webserver" using the Dockerfile included in the repo
Running the container with port 8080 mapped to port 80 of the container
Note that the Dockerfile included in the repo should have the necessary configuration to display a Top 10 list of movies or other content on the webse
